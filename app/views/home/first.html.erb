      This is lesson one! Here you have a basic circuit! Click on the glowing red resistor and drag it to the dashed box that appears!

    <h2>Circuit</h2>
      An electronic circuit is a complete course of conductors through which current can travel. Circuits provide a path for current to flow. To be a circuit, this path must start and end at the same point. In other words, a circuit must form a loop.

    <h2>Resistors</br></h2>
    <p>
      A resistor represents a given amount of resistance 
      in a circuit. Resistance is a measure of how the flow 
      of electric current is opposed or "resisted." It is 
      defined by Ohm's law which says the resistance equals 
      the voltage divided by the current.

      A battery represents a given amount of resistance 
      in a circuit. Resistance is a measure of how the flow 
      of electric current is opposed or "resisted." It is 
      defined by Ohm's law which says the resistance equals 
      the voltage divided by the current.
